Jobless:
========

This is a scrapy spider crawling through freelance job listings in various
websites. Prepares a list of jobs based on given keywords (and in future few
more rules) and publishes the results on a static html page.

Implemented:
============

    - crawls on elance.com, gets job title and links

Yet to do:
==========

    - get job timeframe, description from elance
    - add domains odesk.com, guru.com and freelancer.in
    - create a static html using pelican(probably) or django and push to git pages

This is a personal project, there is no intention of using the data crawled for
any commercial purposes.
